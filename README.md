# time-is-short

## Description
Life is busy! With this simple browser App, one can organize a workday with ease. The date slots are color coded based on time of day and your appointments are easily saved and remain even after the page is refreshed. The current day is always displayed at the top of the page as well. Through this project i learned alot about the use of Bootstrap grid systems. I also utiliuzed clean and efficient code in the JS file to affect the changes i desired on the page. Enjoy!
